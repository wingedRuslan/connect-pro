## LinkedIn Data Extraction Approaches

ProxyCurl API is great **paid** service. The idea was to replace it with a free alternative that can reliably extract LinkedIn profile data given a URL.

## Selenium Scraper Approach
Free alternative: Selenium-based scraper that directly automates browser interactions to extract profile data.

```python
class SeleniumLinkedInScraper:
    # Browser automation to navigate LinkedIn
    # Authentication and session management
    # HTML parsing with XPath selectors
    # Cooldown mechanisms to avoid rate limiting
```
The Selenium scraper implementation provides approximately 60-70% data extraction reliability. While functional for testing, it currently lacks the consistency required for *normal comfortable use*.

### Scraping challenges

1. Linkedin anti-scraping measures
* LinkedIn has detection systems that identify and block automated browsers
* Even with realistic behavior patterns, account hit restriction notices (*happened two times*)

2. Dynamic Linkedin content 
* LinkedIn frequently changes their HTML structure and class names
* Element selectors that work today often break without warning ([./extractors.py](./extractors.py))

3. Data Extraction Reliability
* Critical data fields (experience, summary) are embedded in complex nested structures
* Multiple fallback selectors required for each field to achieve moderate reliability


### Future considerations

1. Account management system
* Implement rotation between multiple LinkedIn accounts to distribute scraping activity

2. Resilient selector system
* Develop a versioned selector database to track LinkedIn UI changes
* (!) Implement a system that can detect and adapt to structural changes

3. Infrastructure improvements
* Add proxy support for IP rotation
* Create a local cache system to minimize repeated profile requests
